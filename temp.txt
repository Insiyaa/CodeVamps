Verbose Summary: 
so the first item on the agenda is something that is useful to us as regarding staff working from home but he can you give us a little bit of a background on some  thanks and  I've been talking to the team we had a stuff meeting last week announced they feel very strongly that they would really appreciate a field a section soak a view on stuff working from high as United they have slightly different jobs to some of my colleagues in that dialogue rising and not necessarily on serving the funds that they find it extremely difficult to concentrate in an office is busy that was on they'd like to feel that they are working from home was endorsed by some kind of policy view rather than something that was a base out whole Catherine's made to feel guilty about and something else to bring this issue to the senior management team lead off we've never objected to stop working from home the full if from time to time and is of your team wanted what I'm not that's fine I mean why do you feel that we need to put a policy in place regarding this I mean what time we just continue as we are facing a single we can 
the only additional thing I would say is that it is a competitive market town that and flexible working is increasingly something that happens in a kind of field and family friendly work means today do you think it's something we should look at that may be reasons as well I need to hear as to why it's not going to work but I do think it's something we should continue to explore because I think the team would feel very fed up with it was just built on the head of this point
