Verbose Summary: 
Marcus is leading this month's meeting  we're  morning everyone  very much for being here on time we got a lot to do today to so let's get started 
to item four where it says presentation of online survey results  the presentation is going to be given by miss Patricia ray us who is a representative of the research company we contracted to carry out the work the mistress will arrive at eleven says he so I plan to break it's about eleven fifteen to give her time to set up it may also mean that we need to interrupt the first few agenda right terms but we'll come back to those and also I'd like to leave a little bit of time on the any of the business to discuss whatever might come out to the presentation 
well from my point of view what Paul is proposing sounds fine I am a bit concerned about working with the system of Corvallis and inflexible I was but I think we all need time to read through Kohl's proposal in more detail before discussing it any further
